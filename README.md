MOST UP-TO-DATE FILES ON THE "NEW" BRANCH

- Set in space
- Top-down
- Mouse-click movement
- Visitable space stations
- Visitable planets
- Tradable commodities
- Missions

- First-person dogfighting

If it needed to be compared with other games, I'd say Mount & Blade for the top-down + mouse movement, and Elite Dangerous for the dogfights
